__Virtual Machine Concept__ - An effective way of showing how each layer in a computer architecture represents an abstraction of a machine

A computer can usually execute programs written in its native machine language.
- each instruction in ML is simple enough to be executed using a small number of electronic circuits -- call this language __L0__
	- Difficult to write because it is detailed and consists purely of numbers
	- Second language, __L1__, could be constructed that's easier to use
	- Could be achieved two ways:
		- __Interpretation__: As L1 program is running, each of its instructions could be decoded and executed by a program written in L0.
			- L1 begins running immediately, but each instruction has to be decoded before it can execute -- causing a small delay
		- __Translation__: Entire L1 program could be converted to an L0 program by an L0 program specifically designed for translation. Resulting L0 program could be executed directly on the hardware.
__Virtual Machine__ - a software program that emulates the functions of some other physical or virtual computer
