# Number Systems
I wrote a series of blog posts about converting between different number systems after failing an exam in _Data Structures and Algorithms_ because I hadn't bothered to learn beforehand.
The first post is here: [CS Basics: Binary Conversion](https://trainingmontage.dev/posts/cs-basics-binary-conversion/)
## Decimal
The decimal number system is the one we use in everyday life. Because we use it so much we don't give it much thought (well, most of us).
Base-10 numbers are composed of 10 possible digits (0 - 9). Each digit has the power of 10 associated with it.
Here's a breakdown, using the number `555`:

| $10^2$ | $10^1$ | $10^0$ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 5      | 5      | 5      |

## Binary
## Hexadecimal
