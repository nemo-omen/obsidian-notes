## Memory
The basic unit of memory is a `byte`. A computer w/32 megabytes of memory can hold about 32 million bytes of information.
Each byte in memory is by a unique number, its `address`

| Address    | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7  | |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Memory__ | 2A  | 45  | B8  | 20  | 8F  | CD  | 12  | 2E |   |

Memory is measured in units of: 
__kilobytes__ $2^{10}= 1,024 \text{ bytes}$
__megabytes__ $2^{20}= 1,048,576 \text{ bytes}$
__gigabytes__ $2^{30}=1,073,741,824 \text{ bytes}$

__All data in memory is numeric__. Characters are stored using _character codes_ (ASCII, UTF8, UTF16)

- ASCII uses one byte to encode a character.
- UTF16 uses 16 bits (2 bytes)
