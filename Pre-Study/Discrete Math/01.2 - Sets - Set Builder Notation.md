We can create rules and use variables when describing and building a set. This can allow us to be more flexible, and more easily understood.

EX: The set for rational numbers:

$\large
\Bbb{Q} = \{ ...1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, ... \}
$

With __set builder notation__

__Set builder notation__:

$\Large \{\text{rule } | \text{ condition for variables}\}$

$\Large \mid \text{=} \text{ 'such that'}$

$\large
\Bbb{Q} = \{m/n \mid m,n \in \Bbb Z \text{ and } n \neq 0 \}
$

In English: All fractions ($m/n$) such that $m$ and $n$ are both integers and $n$ does not equal $0$.

Practice examples:
1. Consider creating a set for things on your bedside table, write the set with _set builder notation_.

$\text{Bedside table }=\{\text{phone }, \text{wallet }, \text{notebook }\}$

$\Large B.T.=\{x \mid x \text{ is on the }B.T.\}$

2. Create a subset containing the positive odd integers using _set builder notation_.

$\large
B = \{ 2n+1 \mid n \in \Bbb N\} \text{ (assuming \Bbb N includes 0)}
$

$\large
B = \{ 2n+1 \}
$
