We can create rules and use variables when describing and building a set. This can allow us to be more flexible, and more easily understood.

EX: The set for rational numbers:

$\large
\Bbb{Q} = \{ ...1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, ... \}
$

With __set builder notation__

$\large
\Bbb{Q} = \{  \}
$

__Set builder notation__:

$\Large \{\text{rule } | \text{ condition for variables}\}$

$\Large \mid$
