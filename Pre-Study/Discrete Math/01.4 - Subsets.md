B is a subset of A if every element in B is also in A.

$$\Large B \subseteq A $$

If B is not a subset of A:


$$\Large B \nsubseteq A $$

The empty set is a subset of __any and all__ sets


$$\Large \emptyset \subseteq \{1,2,3\} $$


$$\Large A=\{1,2,3,4,5\} \space \space B=\{2,4\}$$

$$\Large B \subseteq A$$
